	FLAN'S MOD ++
	CHANGELOG


[Version 1.1.2]
* Added support for "hammer" parts that rotate when a gun is fired.
	- For modelers: set your gun's hammer parts to an unused group in SMP Toolbox (i.e. RevolverBarrel) and export it.  Then replace the normal group name (i.e. "revolverBarrelModel") with "hammerModel" to create a hammer part.
	- Animation params are identical to the barrel break params, but instead use hammerRotateAngle and hammerRotatePoint.
* Added PumpDelayAfterReload, PumpDelayOnShoot, and PumpTime params to gun config files.  These override the equivalent params in the model java files.
* Guns can now be set to have their slides pull back while reloading, then snap forward after a certain amount of time.
	- Enable by adding "LockSlideOnReload True" to your gun's text file, and the time is set using "LockSlideTime" and entering an integer.
	
* Added the "Priority" and "InfiniteAmmo" params to shootable config files.
	- "Priority" adds an extra layer of priority to a shootable item; this lets it be loaded before all lower priority ammo, even if another item has more rounds left.
	- "InfiniteAmmo" prevents ammo from being used when firing guns.

* Vehicle wheels should no longer have entity shadows underneath them.
* Preliminary work on a "preferred-engine" system for vehicles, which tells the game which engine to give a vehicle spawned from the creative inventory.
	
* Additional behind the scenes work on gadget attachments.

* Bug Fixes:
	- Fixed a crash where the Vehicle Crafting Table could throw an index out of bounds exception when there are no vehicles added by content packs.  Credit to 1whohears for the fix. (#3 - Small Drivable Crafting Gui Error)


[Version 1.1.1b]
* Added the "CanRefuelInMotion" parameter, to determine whether a vehicle/plane can be refueled when the throttle is not 0.
	- By default, all vehicles/planes can only refuel when their throttle is 0.
	- Electric/RF vehicles are unaffected, and will recharge regardless of the throttle.
* Fixed improper behavior with vehicles using the infinite fuel trick (FuelTankSize 1)


[Version 1.1.1a]
* Minor tweaks.
	- Halved vehicle fuel consumption rate.
	- Fuel indicator now hides when FuelTankSize is 0 or less.


[Version 1.1.1]
* Added support for model parts that only show up when a sight is attached. ("addonScopeModel")
	- Functions as an opposite for "defaultScopeModel" in the model's java file.
	- Models using these parts will NOT work with base Flan's Mod and Flan's Mod Ultimate.
* Single-use tools can now be stacked.

* Setting FuelTankSize to -1 will now give the vehicle/plane infinite fuel, and will also hide the fuel menu option.
	- Note that setting FuelTankSize to 0 will hide the fuel menu option and prevent the vehicle/plane from moving.
* Implemented "SetPlayerInvisible" functionality for planes; previously this only worked with vehicle.

* Finished adding separated textures for the Gun Modification Table and the Vehicle Crafting Table.
	- These separate textures can be modified with resource packs.
* Vehicles in the Vehicle Crafting Table now have shading and rotate faster.


[Version 1.1.0]
* Added preliminary support for Gadget attachments (Implemented separately from FMU:SE's version)
	- Intended for rail-mounted laser sights or flashlights
* Added preliminary support for multi-stance Grip attachment models, such as Bipods.
* Added a simple render mode for the gun ammo HUD, which only displays the amount of shots left.
* Simplified the ammo remaining tooltip for guns to show how many shots are remaining.
	- Hold shift to view details on loaded ammo items and how many shots each item has left.
* Added a per-gun option to show remaining shots as "uses" in the item tooltip.
* Added a remaining shots tooltip for bullet/ammo items, with new per-item config lines to control how it is displayed.
* Added paintjob name tooltips for named weapon paintjobs in the Gun Modification Table.

* Reworked knockback from bullets - knockback can now be configured in each bullet's txt file.

* Added a speed readout to the vehicle/plane HUD, and moved the plane HUD's heading readout to the top-center of the screen.

* Added config lines for controlling the throttle threshold at which vehicles will switch from their starting sounds to their driving/backing sounds. 
* Adjusted vehicle handling to allow for better steering and drifting behavior.
	- "TurnThrottleLimit" sets the throttle level at which point a vehicle will not turn any tighter.
	- Fully fledged drifting behavior.  Drifting is triggered by tapping the brakes will turning.
	- Drifting too tightly will cause a vehicle to lose speed.
	- Traction temporarily has no effect now, pending a future rework.
* Added a boosting ability, which can be activated using the line "CanBoost True"
	- Tap the Pitch Down key to boost.  Boost drains from a power meter when active, and the meter refills overtime.

* Fixed a collision bug that could cause planes to teleport down to Brazil (read: bedrock level) when colliding with land vehicles.
	- This fix uses ported code from Flan's Mod Ultimate: Stability Edition.  Thanks GoldSloth!



[Version 1.0.2]
* Separated firemode indicator from the ammo counter- it is now rendered independently.
* Added controls for whether to show a gun's crosshair in various situations, such as when a scope is attached or when aiming.

* HITBOX FIX: Ported GoldSloth's vehicle part hitbox fix from Flan's Mod Ultimate: Stability Edition.
* Increased how much vehicles slide/drift while turning at high throttle levels; added config values to control this behavior.
* Added the ability to use the landing gear key to reset the yaw of the driver's camera in vehicles.
	- Holding this key locks the camera until the key is released.
* Boats can no longer be driven when out of water; amphibious vehicles still can be driven both on land and in water.
* Boats will no longer apply pitch or roll.
* Added work-in-progress code for Submarines. NOTE: Submarine code is janky and may be subject to change.
	- "IsSubmarine True" activates Submarine behavior.
	- Use SurfaceRate, SubmergeRate, and MaxSurfaceLevel to control Sub behavior.
	- Further improvements and documentation coming in a later update.

* Fixed broken heading readout on the HUD for vehicles and planes.


[Version 1.0.1]
* Fixed hover mode emitters firing when in flight mode.
* Updated HUD for planes/helicopters to add Pitch and Roll lines.
* Added auto-leveling for aircraft; in flight, roll (and pitch for helicopters) will settle to 0 when nearly level.
	- This makes leveling roll in-flight and hovering in helicopters/VTOL planes easier.


[Version 1.0.0]
Initial Release.

Flan's Mod ++ Feature Summary:
------------------------------

* Many new configurable features for guns, including tweakable model kickback, variable accuracy, etc.
* By default, guns no longer can be aimed nor fired while sprinting.
* Added bipod mechanics for grip attachments.
* Improved vehicle mechanics, including drifting, engines that can only take certain fuels, a Cruise Control mode, etc. 
* Vehicles will now throttle up/down faster, and throttle will naturally decay to simulate friction.
* Improved plane mechanics, including increased speed when diving, configurable lift ratings, etc.
* Planes no longer come to a hard, sudden stop when out of fuel, instead uncontrollably throttling down.
* Tweaks to the HUD when driving vehicles; vehicle fuel and VTOL flight mode are now visible on the HUD.
* More item types can now have custom descriptions.
